# Multi-scale-brain-function
Macroscale Intrinsic dynamics and Microcircuit function.

Welcome to the Multi-scale-brain-function package; a companion to our article "Macroscale Intrinsic Dynamics are associated with Microcircuit Function in Focal and Generalized Epilepsies".

# Software dependencies
FreeSurfer (tested with 6.0 - https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/) 
FSL (tested with 5.0.9 - https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki) 
Python (tested with 3.10)
Highly comparative time-series analysis (hctsa) toolbox (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.8155940)
Parameter mean field model (pMFM)

# Preprocessing
Prior to using this package, it is expected that the functional images were preprocessed using the DPABI toolbox (http://http://rfmri.org/dpabi) which synthesizes procedures in SPM12 software (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm). Diffusion weighted images were preprocessed using the FSL, and then structural connectome were generated from preprocessed diffusion weighted images using MRtrix3.
